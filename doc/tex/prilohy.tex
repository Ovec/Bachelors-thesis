\priloha{General test plan}
\label{chap:generalTestPlan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Test plan ID: TP0
    \item Context of testing:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Project: Bachelor’s thesis.
              \item Test levels: Acceptance testing.
              \item Test types: Static and dynamic.
              \item Test items:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes Operator v5.3.1.
                        \item CloudNativePG Operator v1.20.0.
                        \item StackGres Operator v1.4.3.
                        \item Percona Operator for Postgres 1.4.0.
                    \end{itemize}
              \item Test scope: Operator, Operator’s documentation, Operator’s repository.
              \item Test basis: Defined criteria.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Risk register:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Limited staff and time might prevent thorough testing of all features and functionalities of the software during acceptance testing.
              \item Inadequately trained staff might struggle to design effective test cases, which could result in missed defects and lower overall testing effectiveness.
              \item Due to the lack of expertise among staff members, the software's readiness for production might be inaccurately assessed, leading to incorrect conclusions about its quality and suitability for release
          \end{itemize}
    \item Test strategy:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item General: The purpose of testing is to evaluate the ability of Operators to fulfill the desired criterias, and to provide information for making informed decisions on which Operator to select in last chapter. Non-functional requirements will be tested with static and dynamic test techniques.
              \item Test levels: Acceptance testing
              \item Test deliverables: Test plan, test model specification, test procedure specification, incident reports, test status reports, test competition reports.
              \item Test design techniques: Exploratory Testing, Use cases, Walkthroughs
              \item Entry criteria: Created environments.
              \item Exit criteria: Decision metrics were collected.
              \item Test competition criteria: All criteria covered by at least one test case.
              \item Degree of independence: No connection between tested Operators and tester. Tester is fully independent.
              \item Metrics to be collected:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Static testing: Vulnerability analysis (number of vulnerabilities and their severity), Repository review (sum of issues, sum of repaired issues, sum of stars, sum of commits), Documentation review (examples, training needed),
                        \item Dynamic testing:  Sum of passed, ignored and failed tests. Peromance described by transactions per second.
                    \end{itemize}
              \item Test data requirements:

\textbf{Test completition report}

Testing performed: Repositories walkthrough, repositories cloning, Percona Jira walkthrough

Deviations from planed testing: Percona is using Jira for tracking issues. To get issues Jira walkthrough was necessary. To count number of commits and get the date of first commit the repository cloning was necessary.

Test completion evaluation: The testing process was successful in gathering key data about the system despite deviations from the initial plan. The flexibility in testing procedures resulted in a more comprehensive evaluation and provided valuable insights into the system.

Factors that blocked progress: reposistory clonning, Jira walkthrough

Test Result Analysis: The tests provided valuable data about the state and history of repositories, as well as key insights into issue tracking.

Lessons Learned: The necessity to deviate from the initial test plan underlines the importance of flexibility in testing procedures. An adaptive approach can lead to a more thorough evaluation and better data collection.

\textbf{Test completition report}

Testing performed: Checklist-based Testing

Deviations from planed testing: None

Test completion evaluation: The testing process was successful.

Factors that blocked progress: None

Test Result Analysis: The tests provided valuable data about the state of documentations, as well as key insights into Operators operation.

Lessons Learned: Future projects should be prepared for a high level of diversity in documentations. This might involve allocating more time for research or including personnel with a broader range of expertise.
